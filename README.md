# openlane_build_script
This script builds openlane and all its dependencies on an Ubuntu (only) System.
There are two scripts in this repo namely:
 - openlane_script.sh
 - openlane_script_wo_depends.sh
 
**openlane_script.sh** is a standalone script where it builds openlane and all its dependencies; While **openlane_script_wo_depends.sh** works in conjunction with [vsdflow script](https://github.com/kunalg123/vsdflow); where it builds only openlane (hence lesser time).

# STEPS TO BUILD OPENLANE

1. `git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script`
2. `sudo -i` #switch to root user (compulsory).
3. Change directory to where openlane_build_script folder was cloned. `cd /path/to/openlane_build_script`
4. Execute the script as below:
     
     - **For build in conjunction with vsdflow**
       
        - Copy the `openlane_script_wo_depends.sh` to vsdflow folder.
        - `chmod 775  openlane_script_wo_depends.sh`
      
      - **For standalone build**
       
        - `./openlane_script.sh` 
4. This script would create following directory structure:

- **For build in conjunction with vsdflow**
```bash

# STEPS TO RUN OPENLANE

1. Go to /path/to/openlane (i.e., ~/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane)
2. `export PDK_ROOT=<absolute path to where skywater-pdk and open_pdks reside>`
   
   - For eg.: `export PDK_ROOT= /home/<username>/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks`

3. `docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) openlane:rc2`
   - If you face "permission denied" after executing the above command, just restart the machine once. Else login logout of the user to see the changes reflect immediately.

4. `./flow.tcl -design spm`
(the above flow.tcl command will run RTL2GDS flow for design named "spm". Same can be done for other designs which are present in ~/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs)
5. Refer to: https://github.com/efabless/openlane for detailed instructions.
